# Purpose

This is a sample setup to demonstrate how to share publication links granting access to a single study.
This setup uses Keycloak to authenticate users.

# Description

This demo contains:

- an `orthanc` container.
- an `orthanc-db` container to handle the orthanc postgreSQL database.
- an `orthanc-auth-service` container that generates and validates tokens + interfaces with Keycloak.
- an `orthanc-keycloak` container that handles users and roles.
- a `keycloak-db` container to handle the keycloak postgreSQL database.
- an `orthanc-nginx` container acting as a reverse proxy in front of the other containers.
- an `ohif-v3` container hosting the OHIF viewer

# Warning

**Disclaimer**: this sample is provided 'as is' without any guarantee.  Don't use it in production unless you perfectly understand every part of it.

Before you use it in production make sure to update all hardcoded passwords and secret keys (search for `change-me`).

# Starting the setup

To start the setup, type: `docker compose up`.  Some containers will restart multiple times while waiting for the Keycloak container to be ready.

Note: this setup is using a dedicated container to serve OHIF.  However,
since March 2024, the mainline version of the OHIF plugin can be used instead.
Check for "OHIF-plugin" in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to replace the OHIF container by the OHIF plugin.

# demo

## As an admin user

- Open the Orthanc UI at [http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/](http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/) (login/pwd: `admin`/`change-me`)
- upload a few dicom studies in Orthanc
- Add the `external` label to a few of the studies
- On one of the uploaded studies, click on the `Share` button and then on `Share` in the dialog box and then on `Copy and close`
- Keep the link in your clipboard.  You may share this link with an external user.
- In the left panel, go to `Admin` -> `Logout`

## As a guest user

- Open a new private browser window or open another browser
- paste the link in the address bar
- this will open the Stone Viewer on the specific study but the guest user won't have access to other resources in Orthanc.

## As a doctor user

- Open the Orthanc UI at [http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/](http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/) (login/pwd: `doctor`/`change-me`)
- The doctor user is a restricted user who can browse the whole set of studies but who can not upload/modify/delete them.

## As an external user

- Open the Orthanc UI at [http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/](http://localhost/orthanc/ui/app/) (login/pwd: `external`/`change-me`)
- This user can only see the studies that have been tagged with the `external` tag.

# Accessing this demo from a remote client

If you wish to access this demo from a remote computer, you must configure the domain on which this setup is accessible (in this sample: `mydomain.com`).
Update these settings:
- orthanc: ORTHANC_JSON -> OrthancExplorer2 -> Keycloak -> "Url": "https://mydomain.com/keycloak/"
- keycloak: KC_HOSTNAME_URL: "https://mydomain.com/keycloak"
- keycloak: KC_HOSTNAME_ADMIN_URL: "https://mydomain.com/keycloak"

# Enabling API keys

If you wish to enable support for api-keys authentication (which is mandatory for permissions management from UI),
you have to get the `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` value from the Keycloak logs (displayed only during the very first boot) and
put it into the `docker-compose.yml` file (`orthanc-auth-service` container). Then, restart the Docker setup: `docker compose up -d`.

Here is the old version of this:
<strike>
You should log in the Keycloak admin console and:
- in http://localhost/keycloak/admin/master/console/ (login/pwd: `admin`/`change-me`), left panel: Clients
- In the `orthanc` realm
- select `admin-cli`
- `Settings` tab --> enable `Client authentication`
- `Settings` tab --> enable `Service accounts roles`
- click on Save button!!
- then, `Credentials` tab is available to get the `Client secret`.  Copy it in the `docker-compose.yml` file in `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `Service accounts roles` tab --> `Assign role` button
- **select `Filter by clients` in the combo box** and `view-users` in the search filter
- check `realm-management view-users` and click `Assign`
</strike>

Then, you can add an API-key to a user.  Still in the Keycloak admin area:
- In the `orthanc` realm
- Open `Users` and select the `external` user
- In the `Attributes` tab, click `Add an attribute` and enter:
- `api-key` as the Key and `api-key-for-external-user-that-should-be-a-long-random-string` as the Value.
- Click `Save`

Then, in the `docker-compose.yml` uncomment this line:
- `ENABLE_KEYCLOAK_API_KEYS: "true"`
- make sure that the Orthanc Authorization plugin contains this line:
  `"TokenHttpHeaders" : [ "api-key" ],`

And restart the Docker setup:
- `docker compose up -d`

Then, in a terminal, type this command to access the API with an api-key.

```bash
curl -H "api-key: api-key-for-external-user-that-should-be-a-long-random-string" -d '{"Level": "Study", "Query": {"PatientID": "*"}}'  http://localhost:8043/tools/find
```

This should only list the studies with the `external` label.
